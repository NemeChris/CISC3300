1. What do the id and class attributes do? How are they alike and different? 
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element, while the class attribute specifies a class for at least one HTML element; therefore, the latter can be used for grouping various elements. Both attributes are often used to point to an id/class name in a style sheet, and can be used by javascript to access and manipulate elements with the specific id/class name.

2. What are the parts of a CSS rule? 
Selector and declaration.

3. Explain how CSS rules cascade. 
The “important” keyword trumps everything. If there are two or more rules pointing to the same element, the style declaration of the selector with the highest specificity is applied to the HTML element. If multiple CSS rules point to the same element and are equally specific, the  style declaration of the selector written last is applied to the HTML element. A child element naturally inherits properties from its parent element. 

4. Contrast display: block, inline, inline-block. 
inline: displays an element as an inline element, so neither height nor width values have an effect.
block: displays an element as a block element. It starts on a new line and takes up the whole width.
inline-block: displays an element as an inline-level block container, with the element formatted as an inline element and possessing the ability to take height and width values.

5. What are border, padding, and margin? 
Border separates the edge of one box from another. 
Margin sits out the edge of the border and creates a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
