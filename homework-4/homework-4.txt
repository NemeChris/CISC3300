1. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program – the interpreter – reads and executes the code. However, in compiled language, the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine, which is undecipherable by humans.

2. In dynamically typed programming languages, type checking is performed at runtime, meaning the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime. However, in statically typed programming languages, the type is bound to the variable; types are checked at compile time.

Weakly typed programming languages recognize different data types, but don't use them too strictly, trying to convert data when it seems reasonable. Strongly typed programming languages possess type discipline that is enforced by the compiler.

3. 
var is a redeclarable old school keyword for variable declaration with scopes of global and function.

let is a redeclarable block scoped keyword for variable declaration.

const is a non-redeclarable block scoped keyword for variable declaration.

4. Anonymous functions are functions without a name. 
Higher-order functions are functions that return a function or take other functions as arguments.
Callback functions are functions that are passed as an argument to another function to be called later.
First-class functions are functions in a language that are treated like other variables.

5. In Javascript, objects are data structures consisting of key value pairs.
