1. Hoisting is the creation of new variable, functions, and arguments upon entering a new execution context. Closures is the ability of a function to know variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope.

2. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is an interpreted, server-side programming language used to build webpages. Server Side scripting languages process user input and interact with other servers.

3. Similarities:
Both are interpreted languages
Both are weakly typed
Both support object-oriented programming

Differences:
Javascript operates on an event-driven model, while PHP is more procedural (allowing linear task execution).

Javascript runs in a single-threaded environment, using an event loop to handle asynchronous operations without multi-threading; while PHP follows a multi-threaded model.

Javascript has automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory from objects no longer in use, while PHP uses reference counting to free up memory.

4. PHP supports excellent rapid devlopment, since the language can be easily mixed with HTML and thus requires less configuration.

PHP has wide compatibility and works seamlessly with many web servers and databases

PHP is widely supported by hosting providers, making it cost-effective for deploying web applications.

5. Both echo and var_dump are used to output information pertaining to a detatype; however, echo outputs the contents of a datatype, while var_dump outputs the contents and specific type of a datatype.
